V6.0 Theoretical Discovery System

This module provides comprehensive theoretical discovery capabilities for ASTRA,
enabling the system to move beyond empirical data analysis to genuine theoretical
insight and hypothesis generation.

Components:
- SymbolicTheoreticEngine: Analytical derivation from first principles
- TheorySpaceMapper: Navigation and mapping of theoretical frameworks
- TheoryRefutationEngine: Systematic testing of theories against constraints
- LiteratureTheorySynthesizer: Mining literature for theoretical insights
- ComputationalTheoreticalBridge: Connecting computation and theory
- V6TheoreticalDiscovery: Main integrator and orchestrator

Author: ASTRA Project
Version: 6.0
